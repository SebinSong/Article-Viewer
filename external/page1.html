     <span style="color: #9B172B;"><i>“I like cool/pleasant-looking stuffs.”</i></span><br/>
     This is pretty much the reason why I’m into front-end development. It was last year when I got to know web-development and decided to learn it,
     but It was not until just a few months ago when started finding it truly enjoyable.
     I happend to discover this website called <span class="link">codrops<a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops" target="_blank">(https://tympanus.net/codrops)</a></span> where a lot of cool stuffs created by some skilled front-end experts are uploaded regularly.
Most of the gigs there have a variety of fascinating transition effects in them and that just immediately blew my mind.</p>

   <p><br/>Although I had learned what css animation and transition are at that point, I didn’t take them seriously.
     But every single pieces there was incredibly amazing that they almost looked like artworks."Damn, I'd love to be able to create such a cool thing". I just kept saying this to myself. I decided to dig into it and went through several tutorials that are up on it, and
     created my own things out of what I learned. That's when I started finding coding to be an exciting job, rather than a tedious job.</p>
  <hr />
  <p> One of my favorite parts of Codrops is that this website contains (at least from my point of view) the most detailed information on any CSS properties on the internet. I felt like this is where anyone who wants to master CSS has to come. Even though some of the documentations are discouragingly long, Every single articles That I read was definitely worth the time. I still keep on picking up knowledge and do experiments with them. <span class="author">Sarah Soueidan</span> is my favorite author there. She is an Lebanian developer who seem to have an amazingly deep insight on almost everything about CSS. She usually leaves few outer sources in her article which elaborate more deeply on the topic she’s dealing with. I love that spirit of not pretending-to-know-everything. It reflects the fact that she respect the others who is better at something than her. What a humble act that is!

   <h3><span style="font-size: 120%;">I</span> do love javascript too, almost as much as I love CSS..</h3>
   <p>CSS transition and animation become much more powerful when they are combined with Javascript. It allows me to involves the properties which are not animatable by CSS such as z-index into an effect that I try to produce.
     One of the typical way developers use JS along with CSS is, they set a wanted state of an element to a class and toggle it via event handlers or anything that are mounted by Javascript. That way, a whole lot number of beautiful interactive effects can be simply created with just a few lines of JS code.
     <br/>
    Oh, There is actually no particular website I go for learning JS.
    I usually just search google and most of the times google directs me to this website called <span class="link">MDN<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)</a></span>.
    MDN has a tons of great documentations on almost every aspect of web development. But I didn’t like its textbook-like style at first though. I used to sigh over how dense it's 'only' packed with lots of words even before I started reading. It just says what It wants to say, without showing the visual explanation to help better understanding. It almost felt like reading a bible to me which I mostly fail to last more than ten minutes. But I somehow have been going with it, because it’s pretty detailed and accurate, and even up-to-date.

   <h3><span style="font-size: 120%;">E</span>loquent Javascript and YDKJS..</h3>
   <p>
     There are two JS books I mostly use. <span class="link">Eloquent Javascript<a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">(https://eloquentjavascript.net/)</a></span> was the first book I chose. It wasn't easy to go through at first. The author’s expectation toward the reader seemed to be beyond the beginner-level that I was in. I had to read the same chapter repeatedly(like 5 or 6 times for some chapters) and do a lot of experiments.Now I feel pretty comfortable with it and my coding style pretty much resembles the author’s style which I think follows the notion of functional programming.

     I’m currently going through another book called <span class="link">“You Don’t Know Javascript”</span> authored by <span class="author">Kyle Simpson</span> who is a very renowned developer among JS communities. Except for its insanely large number of pages(Just a slightly less than 1000..), I’m happy with most part of it. As far as I’m concerned, it has the best explanations on earth on closure, prototype chain, this keyword, IIFE, and a lot of other stuffs JS developers may find informative.

    This is one of his quotes that lets me realize how lazy I actually am. it pretty much says the fact that we understand how something works doesn’t mean we know how to use it.
    The only way we fully digest a knowledge is we put it into use repeatedly, for enough times.

  <h3><span style="font-size: 120%;">C</span>odepen.io</h3>
  <p>
    <span class="link">codepen.io<a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">(https://codepen.io/)</a></span> is another brilliant website where a whole lot of creative web front-end stuffs reside. It’s basically designed as a sort of a personal storage page where users can put up their front-end gigs. People generally use it as a space where they do experiments but some people take advantage of it as a portfolio page for getting a dev job. It supports a variety of high-end front-end technologies like Sass, Pug, and all the major JS frameworks and libraries and stuffs out there. My favorite part of it is that they pick some creative and original gigs of their choices on a weekly basis and put them up on the main page. All of them are just mind-blowing inspiration. It always reminds me of the fact that there are a tons of brilliant developers out there and there is just no limit of what we can do with front-end technologies.

<p>The above link is my latest work on codepen. It took me quite a while to complete it and cost enormous experiments and debuggings which totally exhausted me. Currently, I’m working on a new self-project which I will surely put up there once I finish.
